# MAL List Randomizer
A JavaScript to adds random anime or manga to your MyAnimeList list using the browser console.

## Tutorial

1. Log in to your [MyAnimeList](https://https://myanimelist.net) account in your web browser.
2. Open the browser console: Press `F12` or `right-click` on the page and select `Inspect > Console`.
4. Paste the [script/code](https://github.com/recitativonika/MAL-List-Randomizer/blob/88a94e58c6796a5e32de8be602c321b519b62db9/mal-add-random) into the console and press Enter to run it.



 - The script will start adding random anime or manga to your list and log the results in the console (e.g., "Anime ID 123: Success" or "Manga ID 58930: Not found").
 - To stop, close the browser tab or refresh the page.
 - Uncheck `Error` in `costume levels` to make it cleaner

## Optional customization

1. Edit `MAX_ATTEMPTS` in the script to set how many random IDs to try add to your MAL account.
2. Edit `DELAY_MS` to adjust the delay between requests in milliseconds (default is 1000ms).

## Note: Use responsibly, as this modifies your MAL list and makes requests to their servers. Many random IDs may fail if they donâ€™t exist.
